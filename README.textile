h1. Overview

TinyRss is an Android library for working with RSS feeds. It contains a fast parser and customizable ListView output.

h2. Why?

It seems like the standard Java library for RSS/Atom is "Rome":http://rometools.org/, which apparently doesn't work on Android (there's an incomplete port I guess). Besides Rome, there are plenty of resources online for implementing your own parser. I decided to do just that, but package it as a customizable and reusable library. 

Because there's already a de facto standard implementation for regular Java projects, I decided to focus TinyRss specifically on Android development. Therefore, it's an Android library project, not a regular jar. It's integrated tightly with Android API's and is specifically designed to show an RSS feed in an Android ListView (although you don't have to use this functionality).

h1. Integration

The following instructions are for integrating TinyRss into an existing Android application. They assume you're using Eclipse with ADT. 

# Clone TinyRss to your machine
# Import the TinyRssLib project into your Eclipse workspace
# Add TinyRssLib as a reference in your project's Properties -> Android -> Library section
# Create a new class in your project that extends com.tinymission.rss.FeedActivity
# Make sure to add your new activity to your manifest file
# FeedActivity is an abstract class that has one abstract method, getFeedUrl, which you must override to specify the url of the feed to parse:
<pre>
	<code>
		public class SimpleActivity extends FeedActivity {
			@Override
			public String getFeedUrl() {
				return "[feed url]";
			}
		}
	</code>
</pre>

That's it! You now have a simple activity that will present a ListView with the contents of the specified feed.
